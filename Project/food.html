        Georgia is one of the oldest wine regions in the world.
        The fertile valleys and protective slopes of the Transcaucasia were home to grapevine cultivation and neolithic wine production for at least 8000 years.
        Due to the many millennia of wine in Georgian history and its prominent economic role,
        the traditions of wine are considered entwined with and inseparable from the national identity.
        In 2013, UNESCO added the ancient traditional Georgian winemaking method using the Kvevri clay jars to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

        topped with pomegranate or different berries. Colorful assort of Pkhali can be a fine decoration on every feast table,

      <p class="food-txt">
        If translated word for word “Khachapuri” in the Georgian language means “Bread with cheese”,
        but it means more than that in Georgia. There is no “Supra” without Khachapuri, especially in Imereti.
        Different parts of Georgia have different Khachapuri recipe, although “Imeretian Khachapuri” remains as the classic model of the dish.
        To bake genuine “Imeruli Khachapuri” Georgians use Ketsi, although it can also be baked in an oven or on a pan.

        <p class="food-txt">
          “Lobio” - kidney bean dish, is one of the widespread and favorite dishes in Georgia.
          There are many different recipes across Georgia, but the ingredient, which makes “lobio” special in Imereti,
          is “Kvatsarakhi” _ sauce of wild cherry plums or barberry. It’s what gives the dish its peculiar sourness. Green onion,
          fresh garden cress leaves and other herbs, different pickles and red wine are the best options to serve with Lobio dish in Imereti.

          Churchkhela and pelamushi _ their recipes differ in the east and west Georgia. In Imereti, west Georgia,
          pelamushi is made of grape juice and maize flour, while in the East, wheat flour is common.
          Cleaned kernels of hazelnut or walnut lobes are threaded beadlike, plunged in the sweet mass and dried in the open-air -
          this is the way churchkhela is made. Tklapi is a thin layer of dried puree made of fruits or berries.
